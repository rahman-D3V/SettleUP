const FAQ_DATA = [
  {
    question: "How does SettleUP's smart settlement algorithm work?",
    answer:
      "Our algorithm automatically calculates the most efficient way to settle debts within your group, minimizing the number of transactions needed. Instead of everyone paying everyone back individually, we determine the optimal payment flow so fewer people need to make transfers.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I split expenses in different ways besides equally?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely! SettleUP supports multiple split types including equal splits, percentage-based splits, and exact amount splits. Whether someone ordered more food, used a bigger room, or contributed differently to shared expenses, you can customize the split to match the real situation.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do payment reminders work?",
    answer:
      "SettleUP sends automated, friendly reminders to group members who have outstanding balances. You can customize reminder frequency and tone, and the system provides insights on spending patterns to help everyone stay on top of shared expenses without awkward conversations",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use SettleUP for different types of groups and events?",
    answer:
      "Yes! SettleUP works perfectly for travel with friends, roommate expenses, dinner parties, team events, and any group spending scenario. You can create separate groups for different occasions and manage multiple expense categories simultaneously.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I see updates in real-time when expenses are added?",
    answer:
      "Yes, SettleUP provides real-time updates across all devices. The moment someone in your group adds an expense or makes a payment, everyone sees the changes instantly. This keeps everyone informed and prevents duplicate entries or confusion.",
  },
  {
    question: " Is there a limit to how many people can be in a group or how much money we can split?",
    answer:
      "No limits! SettleUP handles groups of any size and has successfully processed over ‚Ç¨2.3M in split expenses. Whether it's a small dinner with 3 friends or a large team event with 50+ people, our platform scales to meet your needs with 99.9% uptime reliability.",
